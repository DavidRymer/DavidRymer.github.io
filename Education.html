   <h2> Education </h2>
        
        <h3>Stanley St. Peters Primary School</h3>
        <p>
            Once David had blitzed through his nursary education, he was able to join primary school at the age of one. Despite his age, he made the other students look inferior to him in every way, both on the field and in the classroom. Just before his second birthday, he took part in a school sports day. He won a gold medal in every event and got signed by Manchester United by Sir Alex Ferguson. One week later he joined Mensa.

         <h3>Seconary School</h3>
        <p>
           David managed to achieve 53 A*'s at GCSE and 24 A*'s at A-level. For this, he was awarded the best student in the world prize. He was then accepted into every university in the world, but for some reason chose the University of York.

                <h3>University Accomplishments </h3>
        <p>
            David achieved 100% in every exam that he took. He did this despite simultaneously lecturing at the university. He was also chair of every society and captain of every sports team.
